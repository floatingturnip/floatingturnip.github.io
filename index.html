                    <h1>What it is</h1>
                    <p>UBC Supermileage is an engineering student design team that builds full sized vehicles with the pursuit to maximize fuel efficiency. We have 3 vehicles on the team. A gasoline prototype vehicle, a battery electric Urban Concept vehicle,
                        and a hydrogen fuel cell prototype vehicle that is currently in the making. The Prototype category vehicles are the ones that truly maximize fuel efficiency while the Urban Concept category vehicle has some limitations and restrictions
                        that make it more closely resembled to vehicles on the road. In 2019 we place 2nd in our competition achieving a fuel efficiency 2229 mpg. I am currently a project lead in the Powertrain division where I work on projects related
                        to the drivetrain such as selecting an efficient motor for our new fuel cell powered vehicle, determining chain and sprocket configurations, and designing light weight mounts and guards for the motor and the chains. Our parts are
                        modeled using Solidworks and we often machine the parts ourselves using machine shop tools such as waterjet, 3D printer, lathe, mill<br></p>

                    <h1>The story</h1>
                    <p>In my first year of engineering, I joined a student design team known as UBC Supermileage. During that time I learned how to design and model using solidworks as well as run simulations and learn more about mechanical design in general.
                        I also got hands-on experience using tools for fabrication and assembly of our parts. At the end of my first year, I was invited to attend both of the team competitions: the Shell Eco Marathon Americas and SAE Supermileage.&nbsp;<br><br>In
                        my second year, I was promoted to a powertrain project lead where I worked worked with others to design a new drivetrain from scratch for&nbsp;our new fuel cell powered vehicle. Some of my projects include&nbsp;on selecting an
                        efficient motor, determining chain and sprocket configurations, assisting new members with their projects&nbsp;and assisting the team with administrative tasks.<br><br>Now this is my third year on the team and I am excited to continue
                        my work as a project lead in the powertrain division. Our goal is to finish building the hydrogen fuel cell vehicle and have it ready to run by the end of the school year<br><br>One of the most exciting parts about being on the
                        team, is that I was given the opportunity to drive our prototype vehicle. From first hand experience, I can definitely say that it is very interesting and a completely different feeling from driving a normal car. When driving this
                        car, you wear a fire suit, fire shoes and a certified drivers helmet for safety measures. You need to be lying down on hard chassis (with no cushioning because that adds weight to the vehicle making it less efficient) with your
                        neck craned at a 90 degree angle to peer through the window in front of you<br><br></p>

                    <p>This is my machine learning class project for ENPH 353 running from Sept 2020 to Dec 2020 which is currently still in progress. The class is a&nbsp;guided, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">self-directed</span></strong>                        project-course to practice some of the most recent techniques and developments in control software and data classification. This page will be updated as the project progresses. All the labs that we work on eventually lead up to
                        a program for a self driving car. It operates in the Linux and Ubutu environment and uses Python and OpenCV for image detection and computer recognition. The competition will run in simulation on ROS Melodic.<br></p>
                    <h4>Lab 2 - Sept 16 2020</h4>
                    <p>Below you will find the outcome of one of the first labs in the course. This is a line following program that is based on a video input. It uses Python and Open CV to detect the colour differences in the video and determine where the
                        line is.</p>

                    <p>This is a robot that was collaboratively designed and individually built, capable of following tape, detecting, retrieving and returning soda cans to a recycling bin. On the mechanical side, It was built using hand tools and corrugated
                        plastic. It uses a STM32 BluePill as a microcontroller and it is programmed in C++ and Arduino Framework. A PID control algorithm was implemented for tape following. I worked primarily on the electrical side of the robot which
                        involved preparing detailed procedures and electrical schematics for teammates during build sessions which include wiring, shielding and connector plans, alongside PCB layout schematics for H-bridge and DC motor<br>circuits.<br></p>
                    <h4>The Story</h4>
                    <p>During the summer of my second year of engineering physics, I took a robotics class. The challenge was to design and build a robot that can pick up cans and place them into a recycling bin. Going into this class, I didn't have that
                        much experience in robotics or electronics so I was a little nervous. Especially since the class was running online rather than it usually was in person.<br><br>Throughout the few months working on the project, I learned a lot
                        about electronics and got a lot of hand on experience building circuits, debugging and soldering. Our team also learned a lot about remote communication during the span of the project. Since we were collaboratively working on the
                        design of the robot but each individually building our own robot, we made sure to prepare a detailed set of instruction slides for our teammates when it was our turn to lead a build session</p>

                    <h1>What it Does</h1>
                    <p>Eco Eats is a hackathon project that was created in 24 hours. It placed top 5 in the hackathon and won the Best Search Engine Experience Award. The app allows users to take a picture of their food and then it displays to the user the
                        environmental impact of their meal in a way that can be easily understood. This includes: number of glasses of water used, CO2 emission equivalency of number of miles driven, and the CO2 emission equivalency of the number of trees
                        required to be planted. This app was built in Android Studio using Java and it was integrated with the google cloud vision API to analyse the food in the photo. Additional research was done to build a database to store the information</p>
                    <h1>The Story</h1>
                    <p>In my second year of engineering physics, I participated in western Canada's largest all female hackathon known as cmd-f.&nbsp;<br><br>I teamed up with a friend from my computer engineering class and we found some other people on slack
                        to team up with.<br><br>Prior to the hackathon, we met up online to brainstorm some ideas but we ultimately didn't decide on an idea until the hackathon began where we decided we would make an app that lets users take a picture
                        of their food and have it calculate the water and CO2 emissions of the meal. We decided that we would make an app and although none of us had any experience with Android Studio, we agreed that we would try it out and use it as
                        an opportunity to learn as much as we could. Throughout the process, we ran into many issues with getting things set up properly and figuring out how to use Android Studio. After getting more familiar with Android Studio, our next
                        challenge was to get the app to open up a camera. Then we also had the issue of how to get our UI/UX design onto the app.<br><br>After many struggles and getting help from mentors and a lot of googling and watch video tutorials,
                        we finally made a working product that we were proud of.<br><br>To our surprise, after the initial round of judging, we found out that we were amongst the finalists and would be doing a demo in front of everyone. We were all very
                        excited about this. We ended up winning the Best Search Engine Experience Award. Overall this was a very exciting experience for all of us and a great opportunity to learn.&nbsp;</p>

                    <h1>What it does</h1>
                    <p>General Overview of Circuit:<br>A servo loop uses a feedback loop to actively control a specific quantity such as its rotation speed or temperature. This has a wide variety of applications in everyday use and is often seen in thermostats
                        and cruise control for cars. This experiment involves designing a circuit to control a motor's speed.<br><br>A disc is connected to the motor with a slit. When the motor spins it causes the slit to pass under an LED. Light lands
                        on a photoresistor which then generates a clock pulse every time the slit passes through.<br><br>The clock pulse is inputted into a counter which counts the number of clock pulses between each reset pulse.<br><br>It then goes through
                        an R-2R resistor ladder network to convert the digitial signal to an analog output which is then compared to the analog voltage of the motor. This output is used to control the current through the motor.</p>
                    <h1>The Story</h1>
                    <p>In my second year of Engineering Physics, I took a ENPH 259, an electronics lab course. As a final project, we built a circuit that could control a servo motor. <br><br>While we did run into many challenges while building and debugging
                        the circuit, it gave us a much better understanding of how the entire circuit works in addition to a good opportunity to develop a systematic procedure for checking components in the circuit&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>This is a robotic claw built using hand tools and sheet metal and programmed using an Arduino controller</p>
                    <h1>The Story</h1>
                    <p>In my first year of engineering, for my APSC 101 course, we built a robotic claw. This was a great opportunity for me to learn how to use hand tools to cut a shape sheet metal. It was also an introduction to using Arduino as well as
                        follow the engineering design process and work as a team.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>In this class we held a competition to see who could score the most points. The first round was the bulk round where the claw had to pick up as many pieces of pasta as possible. In the second round, it was the density round where the
                        claw would pick up objects of the same shape but different densities. In the third round, teams collaborated with their claws to pick up as many various sized objects as they could in a short amount of time.<br><br>Our team decided
                        to do designs and concept generation, prototyping and iteration together and when it came to building the claw, we split up to work on two separate claws, one for the density round and one for the round. My main role was designing
                        the closing mechanism for the density round claw and writing the code that was used for both claws. Our team's claw was able to pick up most of the objects in the density round. And we were quite satisfied with our performance</p>
