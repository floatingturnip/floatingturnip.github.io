                        <p>UBC Supermileage is an engineering student design team that builds full sized vehicles with the pursuit to maximize fuel efficiency. We have 3 vehicles on the team. A gasoline prototype vehicle, a battery electric Urban Concept vehicle, and a hydrogen fuel cell prototype vehicle that is currently in the making. The Prototype category vehicles are the ones that truly maximize fuel efficiency while the Urban Concept category vehicle has some limitations and restrictions that make it more closely resembled to vehicles on the road. In 2019 we place 2nd in our competition achieving a fuel efficiency 2229 mpg. I am currently a project lead in the Powertrain division where I work on projects related to the drivetrain such as selecting an efficient motor for our new fuel cell powered vehicle, determining chain and sprocket configurations, and designing light weight mounts and guards for the motor and the chains. Our parts are modeled using Solidworks and we often machine the parts ourselves using machine shop tools such as waterjet, 3D printer, lathe, mill<br></p>

                        <h1>The story</h1>
                        <p>In my first year of engineering, I joined a student design team known as UBC Supermileage. During that time I learned how to design and model using solidworks as well as run simulations and learn more about mechanical design in general. I also got hands-on experience using tools for fabrication and assembly of our parts. At the end of my first year, I was invited to attend both of the team competitions: the Shell Eco Marathon Americas and SAE Supermileage.&nbsp;<br><br>In my second year, I was promoted to a powertrain project lead where I worked worked with others to design a new drivetrain from scratch for&nbsp;our new fuel cell powered vehicle. Some of my projects include&nbsp;on selecting an efficient motor, determining chain and sprocket configurations, assisting new members with their projects&nbsp;and assisting the team with administrative tasks.<br><br>Now this is my third year on the team and I am excited to continue my work as a project lead in the powertrain division. Our goal is to finish building the hydrogen fuel cell vehicle and have it ready to run by the end of the school year<br><br>One of the most exciting parts about being on the team, is that I was given the opportunity to drive our prototype vehicle. From first hand experience, I can definitely say that it is very interesting and a completely different feeling from driving a normal car. When driving this car, you wear a fire suit, fire shoes and a certified drivers helmet for safety measures. You need to be lying down on hard chassis (with no cushioning because that adds weight to the vehicle making it less efficient) with your neck craned at a 90 degree angle to peer through the window in front of you<br><br></p>

                        <p>This is a robot that was collaboratively designed and individually built, capable of following tape, detecting, retrieving and returning soda cans to a recycling bin. On the mechanical side, It was built using hand tools and corrugated plastic. It uses a STM32 BluePill as a microcontroller and it is programmed in C++ and Arduino Framework. A PID control algorithm was implemented for tape following. I worked primarily on the electrical side of the robot which involved preparing detailed procedures and electrical schematics for teammates during build sessions which include wiring, shielding and connector plans, alongside PCB layout schematics for H-bridge and DC motor<br>circuits.<br></p>
                        <h4>The Story</h4>
                        <p>During the summer of my second year of engineering physics, I took a robotics class. The challenge was to design and build a robot that can pick up cans and place them into a recycling bin. Going into this class, I didn't have that much experience in robotics or electronics so I was a little nervous. Especially since the class was running online rather than it usually was in person.<br><br>Throughout the few months working on the project, I learned a lot about electronics and got a lot of hand on experience building circuits, debugging and soldering. Our team also learned a lot about remote communication during the span of the project. Since we were collaboratively working on the design of the robot but each individually building our own robot, we made sure to prepare a detailed set of instruction slides for our teammates when it was our turn to lead a build session</p>

The app allows users to take a picture of their food and then it displays to the user the environmental impact of their meal in a way that can be easily understood. This includes: number of glasses of water used, CO2 emission equivalency of number of miles driven, and the CO2 emission equivalency of the number of trees required to be planted. This app was built in Android Studio using Java and it was integrated with the google cloud vision API to analyse the food in the photo. Additional research was done to build a database to store the information</p>

                        <p>In my second year of engineering physics, I participated in western Canada's largest all female hackathon known as cmd-f.&nbsp;<br><br>I teamed up with a friend from my computer engineering class and we found some other people on slack to team up with.<br><br>Prior to the hackathon, we met up online to brainstorm some ideas but we ultimately didn't decide on an idea until the hackathon began where we decided we would make an app that lets users take a picture of their food and have it calculate the water and CO2 emissions of the meal. We decided that we would make an app and although none of us had any experience with Android Studio, we agreed that we would try it out and use it as an opportunity to learn as much as we could. Throughout the process, we ran into many issues with getting things set up properly and figuring out how to use Android Studio. After getting more familiar with Android Studio, our next challenge was to get the app to open up a camera. Then we also had the issue of how to get our UI/UX design onto the app.<br><br>After many struggles and getting help from mentors and a lot of googling and watch video tutorials, we finally made a working product that we were proud of.<br><br>To our surprise, after the initial round of judging, we found out that we were amongst the finalists and would be doing a demo in front of everyone. We were all very excited about this. We ended up winning the Best Search Engine Experience Award. Overall this was a very exciting experience for all of us and a great opportunity to learn.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>The problem we were solving is that people experiencing homelessness and without a permanent address lose access to government benefits (welfare, food stamps), healthcare, banks, jobs, and more. They also have trouble obtaining official documents without a mailing address and getting your first piece of ID is notoriously hard because most IDs require an existing form of ID.<br><br>Paper Homes is a web application designed for individuals experiencing homelessness to get matched with an address of a vacant home donated by a property owner. Our process to receive proper identification and a permanent address greatly increases their chance of finding stability and recovering from this period of instability.<br></p>
                        <h1>The Story</h1>
                        <p>In my third year of Engineering Physics, I participated in a virtual hackathon at Stanford known as Treehacks.<br><br>For this hackathon, I didn't know any of my teammates prior to event.&nbsp;<br><br>A few hours before the hackathon, we met up online and we already had an idea that we liked in mind. We decided that we would make a web application using React. Although I didn't have much experience with React prior to this hackathon, I took on a mostly front end role on this project developing the dashboard for the site. I worked closely with our UI/UX designer, refering to the Figma design and trying to make the website closely match to the design. Throughout the process, I learned a lot of React, Html, CSS and JavaScript. In addition, I also helped on the backend side integrating with Firebase to retrieve the user details depending on the specific user. From working on that, I learned a lot about post/get requests and async functions in JavaScript.<br><br>We ended up winning the&nbsp;<br>Art, Tech, and Activism Prize along with the Practice Safe CS: Ethical Frameworks for Technology’s Future prize! Overall this was a very exciting experience for all of us and a great opportunity to learn.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Pillvisor is a smart pillbox made using a combination of hardware and machine learning. The interface that allows the user to set up the alarms is made with Python Flask which stores the alarms to firebase. A raspberry pi is synchronized to firebase to read the alarm times. When the alarm time comes, a buzzer noise goes off and keeps ringing until the user opens the correct pill box. This is evaluated using photoresistors under each pill box day to detect the opening and closing. Then the user can place their pill under the camera and a tensorflow model is used to verify that the correct pill was taken.</p>

We all had different engineering backgrounds and wanted to utilize this opportunity to take advantage of our different skillsets by working on a project that wasn't purely software<br><br>Prior to the hackathon, we met up online to brainstorm some ideas and when we agreed on the project idea, we went to make sure we had all the hardware and software we needed installed properly to ensure things would go smoothly.<br><br>I worked mainly on the machine learning aspect of the project developing a convolutional neural network that could recognize pills. I was excited about this because I had just finished my machine learning course and was very excited to get to apply some of the things I learned in class to another project. So I worked on developing a convolutional neural network.<br><br>One of the things we struggled with the most was trying to integrate the neural network with the rest of the program due to issues importing tensorflow onto the raspberry pi.<br><br>In the end our team won Best Hardware Hack and we were super proud of what we accomplished<br><br></p>

                    <p>General Overview of Circuit:<br>A servo loop uses a feedback loop to actively control a specific quantity such as its rotation speed or temperature. This has a wide variety of applications in everyday use and is often seen in thermostats and cruise control for cars. This experiment involves designing a circuit to control a motor's speed.<br><br>A disc is connected to the motor with a slit. When the motor spins it causes the slit to pass under an LED. Light lands on a photoresistor which then generates a clock pulse every time the slit passes through.<br><br>The clock pulse is inputted into a counter which counts the number of clock pulses between each reset pulse.<br><br>It then goes through an R-2R resistor ladder network to convert the digitial signal to an analog output which is then compared to the analog voltage of the motor. This output is used to control the current through the motor.</p>
                    <h1>The Story</h1>
                    <p>In my second year of Engineering Physics, I took a ENPH 259, an electronics lab course. As a final project, we built a circuit that could control a servo motor. <br><br>While we did run into many challenges while building and debugging the circuit, it gave us a much better understanding of how the entire circuit works in addition to a good opportunity to develop a systematic procedure for checking components in the circuit&nbsp;</p>

                        <h1>The Story</h1>
                        <p>In my first year of engineering, for my APSC 101 course, we built a robotic claw. This was a great opportunity for me to learn how to use hand tools to cut a shape sheet metal. It was also an introduction to using Arduino as well as follow the engineering design process and work as a team.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>In this class we held a competition to see who could score the most points. The first round was the bulk round where the claw had to pick up as many pieces of pasta as possible. In the second round, it was the density round where the claw would pick up objects of the same shape but different densities. In the third round, teams collaborated with their claws to pick up as many various sized objects as they could in a short amount of time.<br><br>Our team decided to do designs and concept generation, prototyping and iteration together and when it came to building the claw, we split up to work on two separate claws, one for the density round and one for the round. My main role was designing the closing mechanism for the density round claw and writing the code that was used for both claws. Our team's claw was able to pick up most of the objects in the density round. And we were quite satisfied with our performance</p>

                        <p>In my second year of Engineering Physics, I participated in UBC's local hack day, as a project we made a website that allows students to sign up to connect with each other and participate in a casual conversation</p>
                        <p>This website was a great introduction to hackathons for our team and we used this as an opportunity to learn and practice html, css and javascript</p>

                        <p>Kamino Game is a class project for CPEN 221, Principles of Software Construction. The goal of the project is to develop methods to allow a spaceship to navigate through a map, and find it's target planet and then gather as much spice as possible without running out of fuel.<br><br>I developed algorithms and created datatypes to represent a graph alongside my partner Emily. Algorithms developed include a depth first search, minimum spanning tree, and a shortest path algorithm. JUnit testing was used to achieve 100% branch coverage and to cover corner cases. Some software principles were applied to this project such as Generics, Abstraction, and Mutability</p>
                        <h2>The Story</h2>
                        <p>In my second year of Engineering Physics, I took a class known as CPEN 221, Principles of Software Construction. We did 3 projects in this course with a partner, each of which took between 1-2 months. Kamino Game was the second project in the course and was my favourite project overall! (Hence why it is feature on this site :D ) And we earned a perfect score on this project!<br><br>When my partner and I began this project, we were a little worried since the project requirements seemed to require a lot and we were still relatively new to software development. As the weeks progressed and we worked on the project we became more confident as we were able to develop these algorithms that initially seemed challenging to us. And we had fun interacting with the GUI interface that was provided for the project simulation!<br><br>The project was split into 3 tasks:&nbsp;<br>Task 1: create methods to represent a graph such as adding/deleting edges and vertices, as well as being able to get the neighboring vertices of a given vertex<br>Task 2: develop a get shortest path algorithm and a minimum spanning tree algorithm<br>Task 3: Interface the graph representation code with the spaceship game by developing methods for the 2 stages of the game. The 1st stage was to implement a search algorithm to find the target planet Kamino. The 2nd stage was to return to Earth given a limited amount of fuel and gather as much spice as possible<br><br>We chose to implement a depth search algorithm as we were limited in time and it was an easier algorithm to implement than a breadth first search algorithm.&nbsp;<br>To return to Earth, we chose to find the shortest path back to Earth first and then search through each planet to see if there was enough fuel to reach there and return to Earth. Thus ensuring we would always be able to return to Earth.<br>While our algorithms were not optimized to maximize score and definitely had room for improvement, we ensured that they were reliable and guaranteed they would meet the passing criteria for any given map which is allowed us to meet the threshold to earn a perfect score on this project. If we were given more time we would optimize to algorithms to earn a higher score within the game.<br></p>
